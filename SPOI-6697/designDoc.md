# Design doc for HDFS output module (tuple based)

## Objective
This module is responsible for writing incoming data into HDFS.

## Funcationality
This module assumes that all incoming tuples are to be written to the same destination file path.
After max file size limit is reached; output will be rolled over to the new file with incremental id suffixed to it.

For example, if module is configured to write to filePath `\user\username\path\to\destination\filename.txt` and max file size is set to 100 MB.
Then, output will be rolled over to filename.txt.1, filename.txt.2 ...

## Dependancies

This module will have a concrete implementation which extends  `com.datatorrent.lib.io.fs.AbstractFileOutputOperator` under malhar library.
Thus, it is heavily dependent on the functionality provided by that operator.

## Risks

Any changes in the functionality or side-effects of code changes done in  `com.datatorrent.lib.io.fs.AbstractFileOutputOperator` under malhar library will have an impact on the behavior of this module.


## DAG
![HDFS output module (tuple based) DAG](dag.png "DAG for HDFS output module (tuple based)")


## Properties
```java
//Path for the output file
String filePath

//The maximum length in bytes of a rolling file.
Long maxLength = Long.MAX_VALUE

 ```

## Attributes
```java
//No. of static partitions to be used for this module
int partitionCount
```

 ## Input ports

 - **input**: Input port to receive incoming data to be written to HDFS. Incoming tuples should implement `FileOutputData` interface mentioned [Interfaces section](#interfaces).


## Output ports
Since this is output module; it will not have any output ports.

## Config UI
![HDFS output module (tuple based) Config UI](ui.png "Config UI for HDFS output module (tuple based)")

## Counters

- Total number of bytes written
- Total number of messages written
- Number of bytes written per second
- Number of messages written per second

## Dashboard Widgets

- Total number of bytes written : Single value widget
- Total number of messages written : Single value widget
- Number of bytes written per second : Line chart
- Number of messages written per second : Line chart

## Usage cases
- dtingest: Copying messages from Kafka to HDFS
- writing output of Dedup to HDFS

## Pathalogical cases
- More than one instances of the HDFS output module writing to the same filePath. This case will not be handled in the first cut implementation.

## Future work

Adding support for writing to multiple files. One way to achieve this is as follows:


 Each incoming tuple must implement following interface

 ```java
 public interface FileOutputData
 {
   public String getFileName();
   public byte[] getBytesForTuple();
 }

 ```

 Thus, each tuple will have information about which file to write and what data to write.
