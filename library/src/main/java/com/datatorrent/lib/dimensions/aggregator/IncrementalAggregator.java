/**

 * {@link IncrementalAggregator}s perform aggregations in place, on a field by field basis. For example if we have a
 * field cost, an incremental aggregator would take a new value of cost and aggregate it to an aggregate value for
 * cost. No fields except the cost field are used in the computation of the cost aggregation in the case of an
 * {@link IncrementalAggregator}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link IncrementalAggregator}s are intended to be used with subclasses of
 * {@link com.datatorrent.lib.dimensions.AbstractDimensionsComputationFlexibleSingleSchema}. The way in which
 * {@link IncrementalAggregator}s are used in this context is that a batch of fields to be aggregated by the aggregator
 * are provided in the form of an {@link InputEvent}. For example, if there are two fields (cost and revenue), which
 * will be aggregated by a sum aggregator, both of those fields will be included in the {@link InputEvent} passed to
 * the sum aggregator. And the {DimensionsEventregate} event produced by the sum aggregator will contain two fields,
 * one for cost and one for revenue.
