/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents an On The Fly Aggregator. On the fly aggregators represent a class
 * of aggregations which use the results of incremental aggregators, which implement the
 * {@link com.datatorrent.lib.dimensions.aggregator.IncrementalAggregator} interface. An example of an aggregation which
 * needs to be performed on the fly is average. Average needs to be performed on the fly because average cannot be
 * computed with just an existing average and a new data item, an average required the sum of all data items, and the
 * count of all data items. An example implementation of average is {@link AggregatorAverage}. Also note
 * that unlike {@link IncrementalAggregator}s an {@link OTFAggregator} only has one output type. This done
 * because {@link OTFAggregator}s usually represent a very specific computation, with a specific output type.
 * For example, average is a computation that you will almost always want to produce a double. But if you require
 * an average operation that produces an integer, that could be done as a separate {@link OTFAggregator}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The primary usage for {@link OTFAggregator}s are in store operators which respond to queries. Currently,
 * the only places which utilize {@link OTFAggregator}s are subclasses of the DimensionsStoreHDHT operator.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link Serializable} because On The Fly aggregators may be set
 * as properties on some operators and operator properties are required to be java serializable.
 * </p>
